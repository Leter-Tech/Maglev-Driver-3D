# **Maglev Driver**

**Dodge, Drive, and Survive to Your Own Soundtrack.**

**Maglev Driver** is a fast-paced endless driving game built with three.js. The goal is simple: pilot your maglev car through a neon-drenched, night-time city, dodge the obstacles, and survive as long as you can as the speed gets more and more intense, while listening to your favourite Spotify playlist. It's honestly such a stress reliever just cruising down the night road with your favorite playlist on.
